- [ImGUI API mod by Rawra](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3417372413) installed to Rain World,
  with dependencies

Steps:

1. Go to the RainWorld installation folder (`Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World`).
2. Copy following `.dll` files from RainWorld folder to `thirdparty/` folder in repository:
    - From `Rain World/BepInEx/core/`: `BepInEx.dll`
    - From `Rain World/BepInEx/plugins/`: `HOOKS-Assembly-CSharp.dll`
    - From `Rain World/BepInEx/utils/`: `PUBLIC-Assembly-CSharp.dll`
    - From `Rain World/RainWorld_Data/Managed/`: `UnityEngine.dll`, `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`,
      `UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll`
3. Run `dotnet tool restore` once after you have cloned the repository.
4. Create `.env.local` file in the root of the repository, see `.env.local.example` as an example.
5. Run one of the available commands:
    - `dotnet build` - builds the project.
    - `dotnet cake --target=Clean` - clears the `dist/` folder in repository and runs `dotnet clean`.
    - `dotnet cake --target=PackMod` - build the project in `Debug` configuration and packs the mod into `dist/` folder
      in repository.
    - `dotnet cake --target=PackMod --configuration=Release` - same, but in `Release` configuration.
    - `dotnet cake --target=CopyModToRW` - builds the project in `Debug` configuration and copies the mod into Rain
      World mods folder. Requires `RAINWORLD_PATH` environment variable to be set, see `.env.local.example` for details.
    - `dotnet cake --target=CopyModToRW --configuration=Release` - same, but in `Release` configuration.
    - `dotnet cake` - same as `dotnet cake --target=CopyModToRW`.

## FAQ:

> I'm playing on macOS / Linux and not a single mod loaded and no mods work!

Proton configures Rain World to run perfect, however misses one configuration to support modding.
Rain World uses BepInEx library to load mods, and BepInEx requires `winhttp` library to be loaded.
But fresh Rain World installation does not have this library selected in wineconfig.
See these instructions on how to add it: https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html.

For ease of modifying wineconfig, I recommend installing `protontricks` (with dependencies) first.
After adding `winhttp` library, be sure to **UNLOAD ALL** mods in Remix menu, restart, and then load them back again.

Ensure you are running the game with Proton version 9.0, not Experimental, not Hotfix. Changing Proton version might
reset your wineconfig, re-add `winhttp` library if needed (see previous question).
